Note 1: Description sheet says to get user input for n and m in one
mastermind constructor.  It also says not to initialize a secret code until
the playGame() function is called.  Instead, could we take m and n as arguments
when the program is run from the command line? i.e. call
./mastermind_main 3 7 to customize the length and max digit or
./mastermind_main to use defults.

I know how to do this, but would that be a valid solution?
